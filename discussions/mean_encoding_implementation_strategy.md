# Mean Encoding Implementation Strategy

Here is a discussion about two possible approaches to add mean encoding functionality to the current PreProcessor. To skip the details and get to the conclusion: Plan A, a separate MeanEncoder class is preferred. This strategy will well fit into our current PreProcessor as it already handles two distinct types of transformations (numeric and categorical) cleanly. Adding mean encoding as a third transformation type would fit naturally into this pattern. It follows Single Responsibility Principle, and will be easier to test, extend and maintain. It will also allow us to have more sophisticated mean encoding functionalities such as cross-validation and smoothing parameters. 

## 1. Approach Comparison

### A. Separate `MeanEncoder` Class

**Pros:**
* Follows Single Responsibility Principle
* More modular and reusable
* Easier to test and maintain
* Clear separation of concerns
* Simpler to extend functionality

**Cons:**
* Additional class to manage
* Slightly more complex integration
* Need to handle class interactions

### B. Integrated into `PreProcessor`

**Pros:**
* Simpler deployment (single unit)
* All preprocessing logic in one place
* Fewer files to manage
* Direct access to all preprocessing steps

**Cons:**
* More complex class
* Harder to maintain
* Less reusable
* More difficult to test individual components

## 2. Key Considerations for Separate `MeanEncoder`

### Design Considerations

#### Initialization Parameters:
* Smoothing parameter
* Number of cross-validation folds
* Random state
* Optional verbose mode

#### Core Functionality:
* Cross-validation by default (k=5)
* Smoothing implementation
* Handle missing/unknown values
* Support multiple columns

#### Integration with `PreProcessor`:
* Clear interface between classes
* Specification of mean-encoded features
* Handling of combined transformations

### Implementation Details

#### Binary Classification:
* Target values as 0/1
* Results interpretable as probabilities
* Consider class balance
* Use stratified cross-validation

#### Safety Features:
* Input validation
* Fitted state checking
* Edge case handling
* Clear error messages

#### Performance:
* Efficient storage of encodings
* Optimize cross-validation
* Memory management
