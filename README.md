# MLflow Demo 🚀

Welcome to the MLflow Demo repository! 

As a data scientist, I use `mlflow` on Databricks for my day-to-day job and love it! ❤️ In this repo, I will share handy mlflow tips and tricks for you to play with too. 🥂

I plan to write a medium article for each notebok in the repo. Let's see how we go. 💃🏻

🏄‍♂️ **Get Started**:    
To get started with this demo, clone the repository and follow the steps below:
```
git clone https://github.com/MenaWANG/mlflow-demo.git
```
* Create a virtual environment with python 3.11. Helpful tips [available here](https://github.com/MenaWANG/venv_test). 
* Activate your virtual environment and install the dependencies saved in `py311_requirements.txt`
