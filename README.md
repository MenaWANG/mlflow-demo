# MLflow Demo 🚀

Welcome to the MLflow Demo repository! 

As a data scientist, I use `mlflow` on Databricks for my day-to-day job and love it! ❤️ In this repo, I will share handy mlflow tips and tricks for you to play with too. 🥂

I plan to write a medium article for each notebok in the repo. Let's see how we go. 💃🏻
