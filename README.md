# MLflow Demo 🚀

Welcome to the MLflow Demo repository! 

As a data scientist, I use `mlflow` on Databricks for my day-to-day job and love it! ❤️ In this repo, I will share handy mlflow tips and tricks for you to play with too. 🥂

I plan to write an article for each notebok in the repo. Below pls see articles published on Towards Data Science so far. 
   1. [Algorithm-Agnostic Model Building with MLflow](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/algorithm-agnostic-model-building-with-mlflow-b106a5a29535)    
   2. [Explainable Generic ML Pipeline with MLflow](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/explainable-generic-ml-pipeline-with-mlflow-2494ca1b3f96)    



🏄‍♂️ **Get Started**:    
To get started with this demo, clone the repository and follow the steps below:
```
git clone https://github.com/MenaWANG/mlflow-demo.git
```
* Create a virtual environment with python 3.11. Helpful tips [available here](https://github.com/MenaWANG/venv_test). 
* Activate your virtual environment and install the dependencies saved in `py311_requirements.txt`
